## how do i use it?

- clone the repo somewhere
- in emacs
- - `M-x load-file /path/to/repo/bottom.el`
- - highlight a region
- - `M-x bottom-ify-interactive`
- bask

read the source for more (bad) ideas

## anything else i should know?

honestly? you should probably turn back now. this will not improve
your life. delete the cloned repo. uninstall emacs. give your computer
to charity. get thee to a nunnery. repent now, before it is too late.
